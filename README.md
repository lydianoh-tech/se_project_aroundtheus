# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Overview

Around The U.S. is an interactive, responsive web application that allows users to manage a gallery of places. Users can view, add, like, and delete cards, as well as update their profile information and avatar. The project is built with modular JavaScript classes for maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to popular screen sizes for a seamless experience on desktop and mobile.
- **Profile Management:** Edit your profile name, description, and avatar using dedicated forms.
- **Card Gallery:**
  - View a gallery of cards with images and titles.
  - Add new cards by providing a name and image URL.
  - Like or unlike cards, with real-time like count updates.
  - Delete cards you own, with confirmation modals.
- **Image Popup:** Click a card image to view it in a larger popup with its title.
- **Form Validation:** All forms include validation and display loading states during server communication.
- **API Integration:** All data (profile, cards, likes) is fetched and updated via a REST API, using a universal request method for consistency.
